                    Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the
                    Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR)
                    depot at Newton Heath.[18] The team initially played games against other 
                    departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed
                    in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company 
                    green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.
                    By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional
                    football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton
                    Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons
                    before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club
                    starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had
                    become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name. 
                    After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.

                    In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £290,000 in 2020 – the club was served with a winding-up order.
                    Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies
                    (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct
                    interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;
                    on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born. Under Ernest Mangnall,
                    who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division 
                    runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 
                    1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in 
                    the first ever Charity Shield and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. 
                    Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, 
                    but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester 
                    City. In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First 
                    World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until 
                    regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a 
                    yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the 
                    Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor 
                    John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the 
                    extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not 
                    been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed 
                    control of the club.[25] In the 1938–39 season, the last year of football before 
                    the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division
